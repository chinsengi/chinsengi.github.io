I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Lillian Ratliff](https://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/) (ECE) and [Prof. Eric Shea-Brown](https://amath.washington.edu/people/eric-shea-brown) (AMATH). My research focuses on **generative models**, **neural network generalization**, **reinforcement learning**, and **computational neuroscience**.

## Research Overview

My work explores fundamental questions about how intelligent systems learn, represent uncertainty, and generalize. I investigate:

- **Diffusion Language Models**: Developing ultra-fast inference methods via reinforcement learning to make diffusion models competitive with autoregressive approaches
- **Neural Network Theory**: Establishing connections between loss landscape geometry (sharpness) and representation robustness
- **Probabilistic Computation**: Understanding how recurrent neural networks can implement probabilistic sampling and uncertainty quantification
- **Robotics & Vision-Language Models**: Applying generative modeling techniques to robot learning and foundation models

## Background

Before joining UW, I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was nominated for the Dean's Prize (top 0.1% of graduating class) and competed as an ICPC World Finalist.

I have industry experience at **Ai2** (working on robotics foundation models), **Meta** (neural interface systems), and **Facebook** (enterprise software). My research has been published at top venues including NeurIPS, TMLR, and iScience.

## Skills & Expertise

I work primarily with **PyTorch** for large-scale deep learning, with expertise in:
- Generative models (diffusion models, language models)
- Reinforcement learning (policy optimization, reward design)
- Mathematical modeling and theoretical analysis
- Distributed training and efficient inference systems
